# [Game Name] - Godot AI Template

An AI-first Godot 4.7.2 project template featuring built-in CI/CD pipelines, strict documentation standards, and automated agent orchestration.

## Getting Started
1. Click **Use this template** to create a new repository.
2. Ensure you have Godot 4.7.2 installed and add the directory containing the executable to your system's `PATH` environment variable. Make sure the executable is named `godot` (or `godot.exe` / `godot.bat` on Windows) so the command line can find it.
3. Use your AI Agent to build your game!

## Git LFS Requirement
This template is configured to use [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://git-lfs.com/) for all binary assets (images, audio, video, 3D models, fonts, etc.). It is assumed that repositories instantiated from this template will have Git LFS installed and enabled locally.

To ensure your assets are tracked correctly:
1. Ensure Git LFS is installed on your machine (`git lfs install`).
2. The provided `.gitattributes` file will automatically handle LFS tracking for standard game asset extensions.
